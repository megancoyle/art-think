Artist Statement Generator by Megan Coyle

<p>A generator that generates absurd "artist statements." It's my way of poking fun of a piece of writing I've had to do for my fine art, and how it's always been something that my peers and I discuss as being a challenge for artists.</p>

<p>This generator has strings of random, silly statements that have popped into my head, and I've always wondered, "What if an artist actually used these for his/her artist statement?" Maybe you will be the first to do it? :)</p>

<p>More "artist statements" are on their way. As well as some additional styling for the index page.</p>
